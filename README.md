🚀 Features
🔍 Search by Book Title – Get similar book recommendations based on a selected title.

🤖 Collaborative Filtering – Uses advanced models like SVD, NMF, and CoClustering to predict user preferences.

📊 Evaluation Metrics – RMSE, MAE, and R² Score used to evaluate model performance.

📱 Minimal UI Designs – Mobile-friendly UI mockups included (Login, Home, Search, Book Details, etc.).

🧠 ALS-Based Prediction – Estimates biases using Alternating Least Squares (ALS).
